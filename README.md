# Custom Dropdown Select (React + Vite) 

To demo,  first ``git clone`` this repository. 

Next, inside the project directory run the command ``npm install``.

Finally, run the command ``npm run dev``. You should then see the Web App running on localhost.

The source code for the Dropdown component can be found in `src/components/Dropdown.jsx`, and `src/App.jsx` contains different examples of the dropdown (both multi-selects and regular selects) using different various Component API props.
